# **Sirojiddin Boboqulov – Data Science Portfolio**

## **About Me**
Hello, I’m **Sirojiddin**—I hold a Bachelor's degree in **English Linguistics and Pedagogy** and am currently pursuing an M.A. in **English Speaking Cultures** at the University of Bremen. I have developed solid knowledge in **Data Science/Analytics** through both academic and professional experiences, including my roles as:  
- **Founder** at Downtown LC, where I led operations, curriculum development, and business analysis.  
- **Digital Analytics Manager** at Sodiq Academy, where I specialized in data-driven solutions for educational projects.

During these roles, I successfully solved practical business problems through meaningful analysis, applying knowledge gained from hands-on experience and independent learning.  

My Master's thesis research focuses on the evaluation of GPT-based AI models for complex linguistic tasks in multimodal contexts. I have also gained extensive technical knowledge through independent learning.

This portfolio showcases my journey in **Data Science and Analytics** and demonstrates how I leverage tools like **Python**, **SQL**, and others to uncover meaningful insights and drive impactful decisions.
